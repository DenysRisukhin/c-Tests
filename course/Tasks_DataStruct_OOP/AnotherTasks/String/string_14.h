//Unicode Transformation Format. UTF is a character encoding standard that is used to represent text in computers. There are several variants of UTF, with UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 being the most common.
//
//UTF-8: Uses variable-length encoding, with one to four bytes per character. It is backward compatible with ASCII and is widely used on the internet.
//UTF-16: Uses two bytes for most characters but can use four bytes for less common characters. It's commonly used in Windows systems.
//UTF-32: Uses a fixed four bytes for each character. It is less common than UTF-8 and UTF-16.
//UTF is crucial for handling internationalization and supporting characters from various writing systems. In C++, the standard library provides support for handling UTF-8 and UTF-16 through string classes like std::string and std::wstring, and there are also functions in the <codecvt> header for converting between different character encodings.
