//Explanation
//Move Constructor (Graph&& other)
//
//The move constructor transfers ownership of other's resources (like m_adjMatrix) to the newly constructed object.
//It sets m_numCities to other.m_numCities and invalidates other's resources (in this case, sets m_numCities to 0).
//Move Assignment Operator (operator=(Graph&& other))
//
//The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from other to this object.
//It first checks for self-assignment (this != &other) and then moves m_adjMatrix and m_numCities from other to this.
//After transfer, it invalidates other's resources by setting m_numCities to 0.
//Benefit of Move Semantics
//
//Move semantics improve performance by efficiently transferring resources instead of copying them.
//This is particularly useful for large objects (like matrices) where copying can be expensive in terms of time and memory.
//Main Function
//
//Uses make_shared to create the Graph object, ensuring efficient memory allocation and management.
//Computes the minimum tour cost using the tsp function with improved memory handling through move semantics.
//Compilation and Execution
//Compile and execute the program as usual:
//Compile with: g++ -o tsp tsp.cpp.
//Execute with: ./tsp.
//Enter the number of cities and the distance matrix as prompted.
//This updated implementation with move semantics enhances efficiency and maintains good object-oriented design principles,
//making it suitable for professional development and coding interviews.
