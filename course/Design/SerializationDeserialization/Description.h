//The topic that encompasses serialization and deserialization problems in computer science and software engineering is commonly referred to as "Data Serialization" or "Data Serialization and Deserialization". These concepts are fundamental in various domains, including software development, network communication, file storage, and database management.
//
//In a broader sense, data serialization refers to the process of converting data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. Deserialization, on the other hand, involves the process of reconstructing data structures or objects from the serialized format.
//
//In technical discussions, you may also encounter related terms such as "Binary Serialization", "Text Serialization", "JSON Serialization", "XML Serialization", etc., depending on the specific format or protocol used for serialization.
//
//When discussing these topics in the context of software engineering interviews or technical discussions, it's essential to understand various serialization techniques, their advantages, disadvantages, and common challenges associated with serialization and deserialization. Additionally, discussing optimizations, error handling, versioning, and security considerations related to serialization can also be part of the discussion.
